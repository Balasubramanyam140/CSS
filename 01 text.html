        <p>The Bhagavad Gita is a revered Hindu scripture consisting of 700 verses, forming part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a profound philosophical dialogue between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna, set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Arjuna faces a moral dilemma about fighting in a war against his own family. Through its 18 chapters, the Gita explores essential themes such as Dharma (duty), selfless action, detachment, and the paths of Karma Yoga (action), Bhakti Yoga (devotion), and Jnana Yoga (knowledge) as means to attain liberation. Krishna imparts timeless wisdom about the nature of the self (Atman), the eternal reality (Brahman), and the importance of performing oneâ€™s duties without attachment to results. Its universal teachings on righteousness, devotion, and self-realization have inspired countless individuals across the world, making it a spiritual and philosophical masterpiece.</p>
