        <p id="first-para">The Bhagavad Gita is a revered Hindu scripture consisting of 700 verses, forming part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a profound philosophical dialogue between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna, set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Arjuna faces a moral dilemma about fighting in a war against his own family. Through its 18 chapters, the Gita explores essential themes such as Dharma (duty), selfless action, detachment, and the paths of Karma Yoga (action), Bhakti Yoga (devotion), and Jnana Yoga (knowledge) as means to attain liberation. Krishna imparts timeless wisdom about the nature of the self (Atman), the eternal reality (Brahman), and the importance of performing oneâ€™s duties without attachment to results. Its universal teachings on righteousness, devotion, and self-realization have inspired countless individuals across the world, making it a spiritual and philosophical masterpiece.</p>
        <p id="second-para">The Supreme Lord Krishna with the light of absolute knowledge and the torch of esoteric wisdom, rescued Arjuna, whose discrimination being overpowered by grief and despondency as a result of harboring false conceptions, had the incorrect inclination to renounce his own authorised duty as a ksatriya and accept the unauthorised duties of a brahmana. This very subject taught by the literary incarnation, lila avatara, Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa is revealed in the seven hundred verses of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita. In these seven hundred verses Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa has written down all the verses spoken by Lord Krishna in his monumental historical epic, Mahabharata; and with great attention he has at certain places put a few of the verses in narrative form to properly introduce the dialogue of Lord Krishna to Arjuna. Thus this commentary known as Subodini will now commence.</p>
